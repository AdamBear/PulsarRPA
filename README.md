Its unique technology combination allows users to effectively address the complexities and challenges associated with extracting valuable web data on a large scale, ultimately facilitating wiser decision-making and competitive advantage.

Most scraping attempts can start with (almost) a single line of code:

```kotlin
fun main() = PulsarContexts.createSession().scrapeOutPages(
  "https://www.amazon.com/",  "-outLink a[href~=/dp/]", listOf("#title", "#acrCustomerReviewText"))
```
The code above scrapes fields specified by CSS selectors #title and #acrCustomerReviewText from a set of product pages.

Example code: [kotlin](pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/sites/topEc/english/amazon/AmazonCrawler.kt).

Most #real world# crawl projects can start with the following code snippet:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val context = PulsarContexts.create()

    val parseHandler = { _: WebPage, document: FeaturedDocument ->
        // use the document
        // ...
        // and then extract further hyperlinks
        context.submitAll(document.selectHyperlinks("a[href~=/dp/]"))
    }
    val urls = LinkExtractors.fromResource("seeds10.txt")
        .map { ParsableHyperlink("$it -refresh", parseHandler) }
    context.submitAll(urls).await()
}
```
Example code: [kotlin](pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/_5_ContinuousCrawler.kt), [java](pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/java/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/ContinuousCrawler.java).

The #most complicated# crawl challenges can be resolved with advanced RPA:

```kotlin
val options = session.options(args)
val event = options.event.browseEventHandlers
event.onBrowserLaunched.addLast { page, driver ->
    // warp up the browser to avoid being blocked by the website,
    // or choose the global settings, such as your location.
    warnUpBrowser(page, driver)
}
event.onWillFetch.addLast { page, driver ->
    // have to visit a referrer page before we can visit the desired page
    waitForReferrer(page, driver)
    // websites may prevent us from opening too many pages at a time, so we should open links one by one.
    waitForPreviousPage(page, driver)
}
event.onWillCheckDocumentState.addLast { page, driver ->
    // wait for a special fields to appear on the page
    driver.waitForSelector("body h1[itemprop=name]")
    // close the mask layer, it might be promotions, ads, or something else.
    driver.click(".mask-layer-close-button")
}
// visit the URL and trigger events
session.load(url, options)
```
Example code: [kotlin](pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/sites/food/dianping/RestaurantCrawler.kt).

The #most complicated# Web data extraction problems can be handled by X-SQL:

```sql
select
    dom_first_text(dom, '#productTitle') as title,
    dom_first_text(dom, '#bylineInfo') as brand,
    dom_first_text(dom, '#price tr td:matches(^Price) ~ td, #corePrice_desktop tr td:matches(^Price) ~ td') as price,
    dom_first_text(dom, '#acrCustomerReviewText') as ratings,
    str_first_float(dom_first_text(dom, '#reviewsMedley .AverageCustomerReviews span:contains(out of)'), 0.0) as score
from load_and_select('https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1H26C46  -i 1s -njr 3', 'body');
```
Example code:

* [X-SQL to scrape 100+ fields from an Amazon's product page](https://github.com/platonai/exotic-amazon/tree/main/src/main/resources/sites/amazon/crawl/parse/sql/crawl)
* [X-SQLs to scrape all types of Amazon webpages](https://github.com/platonai/exotic-amazon/tree/main/src/main/resources/sites/amazon/crawl/parse/sql/crawl)

# ü•Å Introduction

Extracting Web data at scale is extremely hard. Websites change frequently and are becoming more complex, meaning web data collected is often inaccurate or incomplete. PulsarRPA has developed a range of cutting-edge technologies to solve this problem.

We have released complete solutions for site-wide Web scraping for some of the largest e-commerce websites. These solutions meet the highest standards of performance, quality, and cost. They will be free and open source forever, such as:

* [Exotic Amazon](https://github.com/platonai/exotic-amazon)
* [Exotic Walmart](https://github.com/platonai/exotic/tree/main/exotic-app/exotic-OCR-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/exotic/examples/sites/walmart)
* [Exotic Dianping](https://github.com/platonai/exotic/tree/main/exotic-app/exotic-OCR-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/exotic/examples/sites/food/dianping)

üï∑ PulsarRPA supports high-quality, large-scale Web data collection and processing. We have developed a range of infrastructure and cutting-edge technologies to ensure the highest standards of performance, quality, and TCO (total cost of ownership), even in very large-scale data collection scenarios.

üè™ PulsarRPA supports the Network-As-A-Database paradigm. PulsarRPA treats the external network as a database. If the required data is not in the local storage, or the existing version does not meet the analysis needs, the system will collect the latest version of the data from the Internet. We also developed X-SQL to query the Web directly and convert webpages into tables and charts.

üåà PulsarRPA supports browser rendering as the primary method to collect Web data. By using browser rendering as the primary method to collect Web data, we achieve an optimal balance between data point scale, data quality, labor cost, and hardware cost, and achieve the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership). With optimizations such as blocking unnecessary resource files, the performance of browser rendering can even be comparable to the traditional single resource collection method.

üí´ PulsarRPA supports RPA based Web scraping. PulsarRPA includes an RPA subsystem for Web interaction: scrolling, typing, screen capture, dragging and dropping, clicking, etc. This subsystem is similar to the well-known selenium, playwright, puppeteer, but all behaviors are optimized, such as more realistic simulation, better execution performance, better parallelism, better fault tolerance, and so on.

üî™ PulsarRPA supports single resource collection. PulsarRPA's default data collection method is to harvest the `complete` Web data through browser rendering, but if the data you need can be retrieved through a single link, for example, it can be returned through an ajax interface, you can also call PulsarRPA's resource collection method for super High-speed collection.

üíØ PulsarRPA plans to support cutting-edge information extraction technology. We plan to release an advanced AI to automatically extract every field from all valuable webpages (e.g., product detail pages) with remarkable accuracy, and we currently offer a [preview](https://github.com/platonai/PulsarRPAPro#run-auto-extract) version.

* An applet based on `self-supervised` machine learning and outputs all extract rules, which can help traditional Web scraping methods
* An applet that scrape Web data directly from the command line, like wget or curl, without writing code
* An upgraded PulsarRPA server to which we can send SQLs to collect Web data
* A Web UI from which we can write SQLs and send them to the server

Download [PulsarRPAPro](https://github.com/platonai/PulsarRPAPro#download) and explore its capabilities with a single command line:

    java -jar exotic-standalone.jar

## üéÅ PulsarRPA as a java library
The simplest way to leverage the power of PulsarRPA is to add it to your project as a library.

Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>ai.platon.pulsar</groupId>
  <artifactId>pulsar-all</artifactId>
  <version>1.12.4</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:
```kotlin
implementation("ai.platon.pulsar:pulsar-all:1.12.4")
```

You can clone the template project from github.com: [kotlin](https://github.com/platonai/pulsar-kotlin-template), [java-11](https://github.com/platonai/pulsar-java-template), [java-17](https://github.com/platonai/pulsar-java-17-template).

You can also start your own large-scale web crawler projects based on our commercial-grade open source projects: [PulsarRPAPro](https://github.com/platonai/PulsarRPAPro), [Exotic-amazon](https://github.com/platonai/exotic-amazon).

## Basic usage

*Kotlin:*

```kotlin
// Create a pulsar session
val session = PulsarContexts.createSession()
// The main URL we are playing with
val url = "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1H26C46"

// Load a page from local storage, or fetch it from the Internet if it does not exist or has expired
val page = session.load(url, "-expires 10s")

// Submit a URL to the URL pool, the submitted URL will be processed in a crawl loop
session.submit(url, "-expires 10s")

// Parse the page content into a document
val document = session.parse(page)
// do something with the document
// ...

// Load and parse
val document2 = session.loadDocument(url, "-expires 10s")
// do something with the document
// ...

// Load the portal page and then load all links specified by `-outLink`.
// Option `-outLink` specifies the cssSelector to select links in the portal page to load.
// Option `-topLinks` specifies the maximal number of links selected by `-outLink`.
val pages = session.loadOutPages(url, "-expires 10s -itemExpires 10s -outLink a[href~=/dp/] -topLinks 10")

// Load the portal page and submit the out links specified by `-outLink` to the URL pool.
// Option `-outLink` specifies the cssSelector to select links in the portal page to submit.
// Option `-topLinks` specifies the maximal number of links selected by `-outLink`.
session.submitForOutPages(url, "-expires 1d -itemExpires 7d -outLink a[href~=/dp/] -topLinks 10")

// Load, parse and scrape fields
val fields = session.scrape(url, "-expires 10s", "#centerCol",
    listOf("#title", "#acrCustomerReviewText"))

// Load, parse and scrape named fields
val fields2 = session.scrape(url, "-i 10s", "#centerCol",
    mapOf("title" to "#title", "reviews" to "#acrCustomerReviewText"))

// Load, parse and scrape named fields
val fields3 = session.scrapeOutPages(url, "-i 10s -ii 10s -outLink a[href~=/dp/] -topLink 10", "#centerCol",
    mapOf("title" to "#title", "reviews" to "#acrCustomerReviewText"))

// Add `-parse` option to activate the parsing subsystem
val page10 = session.load(url, "-parse -expires 10s")

// Kotlin suspend calls
val page11 = runBlocking { session.loadDeferred(url, "-expires 10s") }

// Java-style async calls
session.loadAsync(url, "-expires 10s").thenApply(session::parse).thenAccept(session::export)
```

Example code: [kotlin](pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/_0_BasicUsage.kt), [java](pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/java/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/BasicUsage.java).

### Load options

Most of our scrape methods accept a parameter called load options, or load arguments, to control how to load, fetch, and scrape a webpage.

    -expires     // The expiry time of a page
    -itemExpires // The expiry time of item pages in batch scraping methods
    -outLink     // The selector of out links to scrape
    -refresh     // Force (re)fetch the page, just like hitting the refresh button on a real browser
    -parse       // Activate parse subsystem
    -resource    // Fetch the URL as a resource without browser rendering

Check [Load Options](docs/concepts.adoc#_load_options) for details.

### Extracting web data

PulsarRPA utilizes [jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) to extract data from HTML documents. Jsoup parses HTML into a DOM structure that mirrors what modern browsers see. For a comprehensive list of supported CSS selectors, refer to the jsoup documentation on [selector syntax](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/extracting-data/selector-syntax). Additionally, PulsarRPA extends the standard CSS syntax to enhance the capabilities of CSS selectors, allowing them to handle complex modern web page layouts with ease.

*Kotlin:*

```kotlin
val document = session.loadDocument(url, "-expires 1d")
val price = document.selectFirst('.price').text()
```

### Continuous crawls

Performing large-scale scraping or running continuous crawls is straightforward with PulsarRPA.

*Kotlin:*

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val context = PulsarContexts.create()

    val parseHandler = { _: WebPage, document: FeaturedDocument ->
        // do something wonderful with the document
        println(document.getTitle() + "\t|\t" + document.getBaseUri())
    }
    val urls = LinkExtractors.fromResource("seeds.txt")
        .map { ParsableHyperlink("$it -refresh", parseHandler) }
    context.submitAll(urls)
    // feel free to submit millions of urls here
    context.submitAll(urls)
    // wait until all tasks are done
    context.await()
}
```

*Java:*

```java
public class ContinuousCrawler {

    private static void onParse(WebPage page, FeaturedDocument document) {
        // do something wonderful with the document
        System.out.println(document.getTitle() + "\t|\t" + document.getBaseUri());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PulsarContext context = PulsarContexts.create();

        List<Hyperlink> urls = LinkExtractors.fromResource("seeds.txt")
                .stream()
                .map(seed -> new ParsableHyperlink(seed, ContinuousCrawler::onParse))
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        context.submitAll(urls);
        // feel free to submit millions of urls here
        context.submitAll(urls);
        // wait until all tasks are done
        context.await();
    }
}
```

Example code can be found in the [Kotlin](pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/_9_MassiveCrawler.kt) and [Java](pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/java/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/ContinuousCrawler.java) versions.

### üëΩ RPA (Robotic Process Automation)

As websites grow increasingly complex, RPA has become essential for data collection from certain sites, especially those employing custom font technologies.

PulsarRPA offers a seamless method to replicate human interactions throughout a webpage's lifecycle, utilizing a web driver to engage with the page through scrolling, typing, capturing screenshots, dragging and dropping items, clicking, and more. All actions are designed to emulate human behavior as closely as possible.

Here's a representative RPA code segment necessary for gathering data from most leading e-commerce sites.

*Kotlin:*

```kotlin
val options = session.options(args)
val event = options.event.browseEventHandlers
event.onBrowserLaunched.addLast { page, driver ->
    // Prepare the browser to avoid being blocked by the website,
    // or select global settings such as your location.
    warnUpBrowser(page, driver)
}
event.onWillFetch.addLast { page, driver ->
    // Need to visit a referrer page before the desired page can be accessed
    waitForReferrer(page, driver)
    // Some websites limit the number of pages that can be opened at once, so open links one by one.
    waitForPreviousPage(page, driver)
}
event.onWillCheckDocumentState.addLast { page, driver ->
    // Await the appearance of specific fields on the page
    driver.waitForSelector("body h1[itemprop=name]")
    // Close the mask layer, which may contain promotions, ads, or other elements.
    driver.click(".mask-layer-close-button")
}
// Navigate to the URL and initiate events
session.load(url, options)
```

Example code can be reviewed [here](pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/sites/food/dianping/RestaurantCrawler.kt).

### Use X-SQL to query the web

To scrape data from a single page, you can use X-SQL, which extends SQL to manage web data and allows you to query the web directly.

```sql
select
    dom_first_text(dom, '#productTitle') as title,
    dom_first_text(dom, '#bylineInfo') as brand,
    dom_first_text(dom, '#price tr td:matches(^Price) ~ td, #corePrice_desktop tr td:matches(^Price) ~ td') as price,
    dom_first_text(dom, '#acrCustomerReviewText') as ratings,
    str_first_float(dom_first_text(dom, '#reviewsMedley .AverageCustomerReviews span:contains(out of)'), 0.0) as score
from load_and_select('https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1H26C46  -i 1s -njr 3', 'body');
```

To execute the X-SQL query, you can use the following Kotlin code:

```kotlin
val context = SQLContexts.create()
val rs = context.executeQuery(sql)
println(ResultSetFormatter(rs, withHeader = true))
```

The result of the query will be:

```
TITLE                                                   | BRAND                  | PRICE   | RATINGS       | SCORE
HUAWEI P20 Lite (32GB + 4GB RAM) 5.84" FHD+ Display ... | Visit the HUAWEI Store | $6.10 | 1,349 ratings | 4.40
```

For more detailed information on X-SQL and its functions, you can visit the [X-SQL documentation](X-SQL.adoc). 
Example code for this query can be found [here](pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/_10_XSQL.kt).

# üåê PulsarRPA as a REST Service

When PulsarRPA runs as a REST service, X-SQL can be used to scrape webpages or to query web data directly at any time, from anywhere, without opening an IDE.

## Build from Source

```
git clone https://github.com/platonai/pulsar.git
cd pulsar && bin/build-run.sh
```

For Chinese developers, we strongly suggest you to follow [this](bin/tools/maven/maven-settings.adoc) instruction to accelerate the building process.

## Use X-SQL to Query the Web

Start the pulsar server if it is not started:

```shell
bin/pulsar
```

Scrape a webpage in another terminal window:

```shell
bin/scrape.sh
```

The bash script is quite simple; it just uses curl to post an X-SQL:

```sql
curl -X POST --location "http://localhost:8182/api/x/e" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "
  select
      dom_base_uri(dom) as url,
      dom_first_text(dom, '#productTitle') as title,
      str_substring_after(dom_first_href(dom, '#wayfinding-breadcrumbs_container ul li:last-child a'), '&node=') as category,
      dom_first_slim_html(dom, '#bylineInfo') as brand,
      cast(dom_all_slim_htmls(dom, '#imageBlock img') as varchar) as gallery,
      dom_first_slim_html(dom, '#landingImage, #imgTagWrapperId img, #imageBlock img:expr(width > 400)') as img,
      dom_first_text(dom, '#price tr td:contains(List Price) ~ td') as listprice,
      dom_first_text(dom, '#price tr td:matches(^Price) ~ td') as price,
      str_first_float(dom_first_text(dom, '#reviewsMedley .AverageCustomerReviews span:contains(out of)'), 0.0) as score
  from load_and_select('https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1H26C46  -i 1d -njr 3', 'body');
"
```

Example code: [bash](bin/scrape.sh), [batch](bin/scrape.bat), [java](pulsar-client/src/main/java/ai/platon/pulsar/client/Scraper.java), [kotlin](pulsar-client/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/client/Scraper.kt), [php](pulsar-client/src/main/php/Scraper.php).

The response is as follows in JSON format:

```json
{
    "uuid": "cc611841-1f2b-4b6b-bcdd-ce822d97a2ad",
    "statusCode": 200,
    "pageStatusCode": 200,
    "pageContentBytes": 1607636,
    "resultSet": [
        {
            "title": "Tara Toys Ariel Necklace Activity Set - Amazon Exclusive (51394)",
            "listprice": "$19.99",
            "price": "$12.99",
            "categories": "Toys & Games|Arts & Crafts|Craft Kits|Jewelry",
            "baseuri": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1H26C46"
        }
    ],
    "pageStatus": "OK",
    "status": "OK"
}
```

# üìä Logs & Metrics

PulsarRPA has carefully designed the logging and metrics subsystem to record every event that occurs in the system. PulsarRPA logs the status for every load execution, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of system performance. This detailed logging allows for quick assessment of the system‚Äôs health and efficiency. It answers key questions such as: Is the system operating smoothly? How many pages have been successfully retrieved? How many attempts were made to reload pages? And how many proxy IP addresses have been utilized?
