[PulsarRPA](https://github.com/platonai/PulsarRPA) is the ultimate open-source solution for large-scale web data collection, capable of meeting almost all scales and types of web data collection needs.

Large-scale extraction of web data is very challenging. **Websites often change and become increasingly complex, which means that collected web data is often inaccurate or incomplete**. PulsarRPA has developed a series of cutting-edge technologies to address these issues.

We provide a wealth of top-tier site collection examples, from beginner to senior, including various collection patterns, including top-site **full-site collection** code, and collection examples of sites with anti-crawling ceilings. You can find a code example, make some changes, and use it for your own project:

- [Exotic Amazon](https://github.com/platonai/exotic-amazon) - A real project for full-site data collection of a top e-commerce website.
- [Exotic Walmart](https://github.com/platonai/exotic/tree/main/exotic-app/exotic-OCR-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/exotic/examples/sites/walmart) - A data collection example of a top e-commerce website.
- [Exotic Dianping](https://github.com/platonai/exotic/tree/main/exotic-app/exotic-OCR-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/exotic/examples/sites/food/dianping) - The most difficult data collection example.

Our **open-source code** also includes REST services, web clients like database clients, and more. Based on this web client, you can even create a product comparable to the most well-known "collectors" by slightly improving the user experience.

[PulsarRPA](https://github.com/platonai/PulsarRPA) has developed a series of infrastructure and cutting-edge technologies to address issues such as web data management, multi-source heterogeneous data integration, web data mining, and web data collection: supporting high-quality large-scale data collection and processing, supporting the web-as-database paradigm, supporting browser rendering as the primary method of data collection, supporting RPA collection, supporting degenerate single-resource collection, and planning to support the most cutting-edge information extraction technologies, providing a preview version of AI web extraction.

This course will start from the most basic APIs and gradually introduce advanced features to solve the most challenging and important issues.
