PulsarRPA has carefully designed the logging and metrics subsystem to record every event that occurs in the system. This document explained the format of typical logs.

PulsarRPA splits all logs into several separate files:

----
logs/pulsar.log    - the default logs
logs/pulsar.pg.log - mainly reports the status of load/fetch tasks
logs/pulsar.m.log  - the metrics
----

The status of loading tasks are the primary concern. You can gain insight into the state of the entire system just by noticing a few symbols: ðŸ’¯ ðŸ’” ðŸ—™ âš¡ðŸ’¿ ðŸ”ƒðŸ¤ºã€‚

== Loading task logs explained

Here are 5 example logs which report the status of loaded tasks:

PageId is the id of the WebPage object and is unique process-wide.

TaskStatus is a unicode symbol, can be one of the following:

    ðŸ’¯ - Task is success
    ðŸ’” - Task is failed
    ðŸ—™ - Task is canceled
    ðŸ¤º - Task is retrying

PageStatus is a unicode symbol, can be one of the following:

    âš¡ - Page is first fetched from the Internet
    ðŸ’¿ - Page is loaded from hard disk
    ðŸ”ƒ - Page is updated from the Internet
    ðŸ—™ - Page is canceled and remains unchanged

FetchReason indicates why the page was fetched. The reason can be one of the following:

- The page was never fetched
- The page has expired since the last fetch
- The -refresh option is applied, so the page should be refreshed
- The page was scheduled to fetch
- Last fetch was failed and retried
- Last fetched page has no content
- Last fetched page content was too small
- Required fields missed in the last fetched page content
- The page was temporary moved

FetchReason contains one or two characters, it's defined as the following:

    symbols[DO_NOT_FETCH] = ""
    symbols[NEW_PAGE] = "N"
    symbols[REFRESH] = "RR"
    symbols[EXPIRED] = "EX"
    symbols[SCHEDULED] = "SD"
    symbols[RETRY] = "RT"
    symbols[NO_CONTENT] = "NC"
    symbols[SMALL_CONTENT] = "SC"
    symbols[MISS_FIELD] = "MF"
    symbols[TEMP_MOVED] = "TM"
    symbols[UNKNOWN] = "U"

FetchCode is a number which describes the fetch phase state, it's inherited from the standard HTTP error code and is usually one of the following:

    200 - success
    1601 - retry

All possible codes are defined in link:pulsar-persist/src/main/java/ai/platon/pulsar/persist/metadata/ProtocolStatusCodes.java[ProtocolStatusCodes].

=== Part III - PrevFetchTime, FetchCount, FetchFailure, DOMStatistic, ProxyIP and PrivacyContext

last fetched 18m55s ago,    fc:2 |                                                   34/130/52/181/5747 | 60.184.124.232  | 11zTa0r2
----

PrevFetchTime is the time when the previous fetch completed.

FetchCount is the count of all fetch executions, excluding cancelled fetches.

FetchFailure is the failure information of the previous fetch execution, and it is empty if it succeeds.

DOMStatistic contains simple statistics on the HTML document, which are calculated using javascript in a real browser, the format can be one of the following:

    58/230/98/295/6272
    58/230/98/295/6272 (i/a/nm/st/h)

where

    i:  anchor count in the HTML document
    a:  image count
    nm: number count
    st: small text count
    h:  scroll height of the document in pexels

DOMStatistic shows whether the page was fetched correctly, for example, a fully loaded page is usually higher than 5,000 pixels, and pages below this value may need to be re-fetched.

For the other fields, such as ProxyIP, PrivacyContext, no need to explain.

=== Part IV: the task URL

URL field is the url to fetch. The url can be followed by load arguments, or load options, check link:docs/concepts.adoc#_load_options[Load Options] for details.
